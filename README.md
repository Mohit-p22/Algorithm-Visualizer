# Algorithm-Visualizer
The Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive tool built using Python and Tkinter to help users understand and explore different algorithms through visual representation. It covers popular algorithms across various categories such as Sorting, Searching, Graph Algorithms, Backtracking, Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, and Divide and Conquer.

# Features
    Real-Time Visualization: See algorithms run step-by-step with graphical representation.
    Multiple Algorithms: Includes algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, Binary Search, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, and more.
    Custom Input: Users can input their own data sets for algorithm visualization.
    Performance Metrics: Display time and space complexity during execution.
    User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use interface built with Tkinter.

# Supported Algorithms

    Sorting Algorithms: QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort, and more.
    Searching Algorithms: Binary Search, Linear Search.
    Graph Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, BFS, DFS.
    Dynamic Programming: Fibonacci, Knapsack Problem.
    Backtracking Algorithms: N-Queens Problem, Sudoku Solver.
